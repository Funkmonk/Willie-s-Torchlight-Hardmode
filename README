>Hey, my name's Willie and this is a Torchlight modding project focused on increased difficulty/complexity, more aggressive and diverse risk/reward relationships, and generally the induction of hardcore roguelike mechanics into Torchlight's robust real-time 3d game environment.

>This is functional on all Windows versions of Torchlight, but will be most stabile on the latest patch.

  Current features:

-Flat base HP and armor that doesn't scale with level
  -No more surviving the unimaginable just because of your level. If you want a bigger health reservoir, build one. Want more damage? You might not be able to afford the loss of survivability!
-Faster paced, and more intricate combat
  -You die in fewer hits, move faster, reach slightly further, and hit for slightly less, generally speaking.
-Diversified enemy lineup that has to be engaged with accordingly
  -Champion monsters are extremely diverse and difficult, but are accordingly prized targets
-Fully reworked economy to encourage creativity on the part of the player, rather than grinding
  -Normal monster drops are less common but more worthwhile
  -Item value barely increases with level
  -Gold income barely increases with level
  -Item UTILITY is key; sword with most DAMAGE is not necessarily the best, but may well be in a given circumstance
-More complex decision making
  -Not every enemy is necessarily worth trying to kill
  -Any character can use any weapon type
  -All basic passives are available at level one to further cater to diverse builds
  -Fewer stat points and more skill points 
-9 (more to come) new classes, each quite different from the rest
-Diversified and reworked shops

  Features yet to be included:

-Reworked gems with a complex gem combination system (gemcraft anyone?)
-Reworked potion balance/implimentation with a robust alchemy system
-Diversified normal monster spawn types
-Side-branches that will be practically required to tackle the depths of the main dungeon
-Weapon-specific melee range
-Whatever feasible suggested material I recieve from yall!
-fully functional skill trees for each class that include damage/utility scaling with for every stat type

  Steps to play with this mod set:

>IF YOU ARE RUNNING THE STEAM VERSION:
1. Go to %Application Data%\runic games\torchlight\ and open local_settings.txt. Search for "steam", and change STEAMCLOUD: to "0", and IGNORESTEAMCLOUD: to "1".
>IF NOT, skip to step 2:
2. Clear your mod cache with clearcache.bat located in /utilities. To do this, just place it in %Application Data%\runic games\torchlight\mods and run it.
3. Delete or displace anything you have in your users\yourusernamehere\torchlight\mods folder.
4. Delete or displace your current save files in both users\yourusernamehere\torchlight\save and %Application Data%\runic games\torchlight\savebeforecloud.
5. Put all of the folders contained in a given version into the %Application Data%\runic games\torchlight\mods folder.
6. Run the game and hope you didn't fuck up
7. Pick a class and ***run the game on EASY difficulty***

  Diagnosing issues:

Q: "Everyone's naked", "I crash every time I try to run the game"
A: These are all symptoms of the game trying to load with a cache of mod files that doesn't match the current mod files in place, or the game trying to load with a save or number of saves that were generated in a different version of the game or under different mods. This can be easily solved by carefully going back through the steps detailed above.

Q: "I crash every time I get to a certain place, but I haven't restarted the game or tried clearing my cache"
A: restart your game without clearing your cache, and if that doesn't work, try closing the game, clearing your cache, and starting the game up again. You shouldn't need to mess with your saves in the case of this issue. In rare cases, this can also be fixed by going near to the place that causes the crash (but not close enough to induce the crash) and making a town portal. Use the town portal and go back through it to put you where you were originally--near the crash site.

Q: "I crash every time I get to a certain place, even after restarting my game, clearing my cache, and trying the 'town portal trick.'"
A: Email me. It is likely I fucked something up. Thanks.


  General notes:

>If you have any issues installing or playing, and you've read the README thoroughly, you're welcome to email me. This mod is currently in active development.

>Torchlight is owned by Runic Games(tm), and I am not making (and do not intend to make) money from this project. Rather, this is intended to further my friends' understandings of game theory, to develop tools with which other modders may interact with game data, and to try my hand at game development--deep into the mechanic design and balancing process.

>Some files included are (formally speaking) intellectual property owned by other modders, who will be credited when my mod is formally released. I make no claim of ownership to anything created by others--infact I do not wish to limit the public's use of--and creative derivance from--my creations in the context of this mod.
