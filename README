Steps to play with this mod set:
>IF YOU ARE RUNNING THE STEAM VERSION:
1. Go to users\yourusernamehere\torchlight\ and open local_settings.txt. Search for "steam", and change STEAMCLOUD: to "0", and IGNORESTEAMCLOUD: to "1".
>IF NOT, skip to step 2:
2. Clear your mod cache with clearcache.bat located in /utilities. To do this, just place it in %Application Data%\runic games\torchlight\mods and run it.
3. Delete or displace your current save files in both users\yourusernamehere\torchlight\save and %Application Data%\runic games\torchlight\savebeforecloud.
4. Put all of these folders into the %Application Data%\runic games\torchlight\mods folder.
5. Run the game and hope you didn't fuck up!
